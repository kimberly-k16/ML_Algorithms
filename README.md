# ML_Algorithms
This repository contains from-scratch implementations of various machine learning algorithms, crafted during my time as a research assistant. The code serves as a learning tool for students, emphasizing the mathematical foundations behind algorithms such as gradient descent, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
